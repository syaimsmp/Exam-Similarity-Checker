The thesis module is aimed at engendering \r\nstudents with a spirit of enquiry into a research-based dissertation. All projects will include the development of research skills, analysis and discussion of \r\nresults as well as an opportunity to compose a written report in which an evaluation of the relevant literature and research findings are presented. Each \r\nfinal year student is required to conduct a research project under the supervision of a lecturer. Before beginning a project, the student must present a \r\nresearch proposal in a seminar which will be conducted by coordinator.  \r\nMODE OF DELIVERY: Lecture, Supervision and Discussion. \r\nASSESSMENT METHODS AND \r\nTYPES:  \r\nCLO ASSESSMENT TYPE F2F NF2F Total SLT (TLA) WEIGHTAGE \r\nCLO1 Research Proposal  \r\nAll Chapter (5000 words) \r\n6  = 9/11X100% = 81.81% ~ 80% 0.80 \r\nCLO2 \r\nResearch Proposal \r\nAll Chapter (5000 words) 1  = 1/11X100% = 9.09% ~ 10% 0.10 \r\n            UNIVERSITI SAINS ISLAM MALAYSIA \r\nCOURSE INFORMATION \r\n \r\nISSUE DATE: REVIEW DATE: REVIEW NO.: PAGE: \r\n   Page 3 of 8 \r\n-3- \r\n\r\nCLO3 Presentation (1 hour) 1  = 1/11X100% = 9.09% ~ 10% 0.10 \r\nTotal 11 0 79 = 100% 1.0 \r\n \r\n \r\nCLO \r\nTYPE OF CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT TYPE OF SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT \r\nTOTAL     Research \r\nProposal \r\nEthics and \r\nSupervision Presentation \r\nCLO1     55   55 \r\nCLO2      20  20 \r\nCLO3       25 25 \r\nTOTAL 100% \r\n \r\nMAPPING OF THE COURSE/MODULE TO THE PROGRAMME AIMS \r\n \r\n \r\nPEO1 PEO2 PEO3 PEO4 \r\n    \r\nMAPPING OF THE COURSE/MODULE TO THE PROGRAMME LEARNING OUTCOMES \r\nPLO1 PLO2 PLO3 PLO4 PLO5 PLO6 PLO7 PLO8 PLO9 \r\n         \r\n            UNIVERSITI SAINS ISLAM MALAYSIA \r\nCOURSE INFORMATION \r\n \r\nISSUE DATE: REVIEW DATE: REVIEW NO.: PAGE: \r\n   Page 4 of 8 \r\n-4- \r\n\r\n \r\nCONTENT OUTLINE OF THE COURSE/MODULE AND THE SLT PER TOPIC \r\nCLO WEEK TOPIC/CONTENT TLA F2F NF2F TOTAL ASSESSMENT TYPES F2F NF2F TOTAL SLT \r\nCLO1 \r\n \r\n1 \r\nIntroduction to Thesis I \r\n Synopsis \r\n Assessment \r\n Writing format  \r\n  lecture \r\n 1  1 \r\n \r\n  1 \r\n2  Introduction to Research  \r\n Ethics and Plagiarism   lecture 1  1   1 \r\n3-4 Formulating Research Problem proposal \r\nsupervision 0.5  0.5 Research Proposal \r\nChapter 1 and 3 \r\n \r\n 7 7.5 \r\n7 & 8 Research Methodology  proposal \r\nsupervision 0.5  0.5  10 10.5 \r\nCLO1 \r\n3-4 Formulating Research Problem proposal \r\nsupervision 0.5  0.5 \r\nResearch Proposal \r\nAll Chapter (5000 words) \r\n 2 2.5 \r\n5 & 6 Preparing Literature Review proposal \r\nsupervision 1  1  16 17 \r\n7 & 8 Research Methodology  proposal \r\nsupervision 0.5  0.5  2 2.5 \r\n9-12 Writing Research Proposal proposal \r\nsupervision 4  4  30 34 \r\nCLO2 2 Ethics and Plagiarism proposal \r\nsupervision 1  1 Research Proposal \r\n(5000 words)  6 7 \r\nCLO3 13-14 Research Proposal Defence  \r\nDiscussion 1  1 Presentation 1 5 7 \r\nSUBTOTAL 11  11  1 78 90 \r\n            UNIVERSITI SAINS ISLAM MALAYSIA \r\nCOURSE INFORMATION \r\n \r\nISSUE DATE: REVIEW DATE: REVIEW NO.: PAGE: \r\n   Page 5 of 8 \r\n-5- \r\n\r\n \r\nDEVELOPMENT OF LESSON PLAN \r\nCLO WEEK INPUT/TOPIC/CONTENT TOPIC LEARNING OUTCOME TLA TEACHING MATERIALS/ \r\nEQUIPMENT \r\nASSESSMENT \r\nSTRATEGY \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nCLO1 \r\n \r\n \r\n1 \r\nIntroduction to Thesis I \r\n Synopsis \r\n Assessment \r\n Writing guidelines \r\n List the advantages of doing the \r\ncourse. \r\n Name the assessment method \r\nfor thesis I \r\n List four of the writing format  \r\nLecture \r\nStudent will be given an information \r\nregarding on doing research.
